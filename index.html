						<h2>What we do</h2>
						<p>
							Our ethos is simple: knowledge and impact are intertwined.
							<br>
							All of our products and services described below are provided in exchange for donations to charities around the world.
							<br>
							If you are a charity that wishes to partner with us, please do <a href="#intro" class="scrolly">contact us</a> and we will see what we can do for you!
						</p>
						<div class="features">						
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-hand-holding-heart"></span>
								<h3>All proceeds go to Charity</h3>
								<p>Our main purpose is to help aspiring consultants break into the industry, so we do not charge anything for event attendance. All of our "premium" products are offered in exchange for direct charity donations. We do not directly accept any money from our event attendees - all proceeds are processed through the charities' official portals/donation systems.</p>
							</section>							
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-chalkboard-teacher"></span>
								<h3>Case Interview/Skills Webinars</h3>
								<p>We aim to cover a full range of topics with an emphasis on advanced techniques and examples. Most of the free corporate workshops only cover the basics and other premium resources are too expensive for most students and entry-level candidates. Thus, our workshops and webinars are a great way to increases your chances at getting a job offer while keeping to a tight budget.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-user-tie"></span>
								<h3>Mock Interviews</h3>
								<p>During and after our events we often offer 1:1 mock interviews in exchange for a modest donation to one of the charities of our choice. These sessions are 1 hour long and cover a complete business case simulation with detailed feedback and advice. The rates we charge are much lower than the average market rates and all proceeds go to charity!</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-book-open"></span>
								<h3>Prep Guides</h3>
								<p>We're in the process of developing a number of case interview related e-guides that we send to our followers in exchange for a small charity donation. <a href="#intro" class="scrolly">Subscribe to our newsletter</a> in order to stay in touch and look out for freebies in the future!</p>

										<br><br>
										Through my studies and internships, I progressively developed an interest in business development and problem solving - a combination that left consulting as the best career option.
										<br><br>
										Outside of academics and professional life, I enjoy cooking, motorsports and playing the guitar.</p>

										Over the past year, we’ve been confronted by such uncertainty and turbulence that it has nudged me to reflect on how I could give back to society and help others. Having said this, I like to seize any opportunities to develop new skills that could help me grow as an individual too. Grateful to be part of this team, I hope to create a social impact and make a difference together. As the saying goes, “Constant kindness can accomplish much.”

										<br><br>

									<h3>Natasha <br> <i>MBB London Office Summer Offer Holder</i></h3>
									<blockquote>The mock interview session I had with Isaac was extremely valuable, both in terms of the type of case he gave as well as the quality of the feedback I received. The session was also very engaging and he helped me to not only identify my weaknesses, but also suggested tangible ways to improve my casing skills. It made a huge difference in securing my offer!</blockquote>
